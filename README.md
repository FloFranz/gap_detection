Detection of canopy gaps by means of remote sensing.

## Description
Gaps in the canopy are a characteristic element of many of the world's forests, occurring primarily after different disturbance events such as storms. Canopy gaps often have special environmental conditions that may differ significantly from that of surrounding trees, favoring the occurence of certain species. As part of a sustainable and productive silviculture, managers strive to maintain gaps to increase forest structural diversity (Muscolo et al. 2014, Schliemann and Bockheim 2011). Knowledge about the spatial distribution of gaps in a forest stand is therefore essential for forest management and monitoring purposes.

Here, a deep neural network is developed that automatically detects gaps in the canopy using remote sensing data. The remote sensing data used are image-based (normalized) digital surface models (DSM and nDSM) and digital orthophotos (DOP).
